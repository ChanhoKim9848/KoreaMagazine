State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website
<br>
<br>
1. Before I made my website, I have been motivated by some website such as bbc. When we use BBC news website,<br> we can see navigation bar in the header and there are some button and drop down menus that make people use the website easily. <br> So I planned to make navigation bar for my website
<br>
<br>
2. After I decided to make it, I search the website that introduces South Korea on Google.<br> Since there are only a few websites,<br> I planned to make my own simple website which introduces South Korea.
<br>
<br>
3. I also wanted to make my website that every device is available to see it <br> because some websites are unavailable to see when people are using mobile phone. <br>This is also the reason that inspire to use Bootstrap software

<br>
<br>
State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site
<br>
<br>
1. My website is Responsive Web that is available on every devices such as PC, tablet PC and mobile phone. For example, when people are using mobile phone, the website can automatically change the size of the website and show it on the small mobile phone screen.
<br>
<br>
2. As I mentioned before, I decided to make navigation bar and buttons for convenience of using my website. Navigation bar is included in header and there is navigation buttons in footer as well. 
<br>
<br>
3. my website is not only people can easily use but also my website is for every people regardless gender and ages.

State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that
<br>
<br>



Before I started my website, I have been using coding program called Brackets.  However I found a Youtube Video about Bootstrap and I decided to use it because I could make my website quickly and easily.
<br>
<br>
Firstly I had to learn websites' main form such as header, main body and footer and then I needed to figure out the difference among html, css and javascript.
<br>
The Youtube video that I utilized explained how to make header, footer, buttons, div class for coding the html.<br><br>  Secondly, since I wanted to design my website, I needed to use css and javascript.<br>  when I was using css stylesheet, the youtube video showed how to link my html to css stylesheet and explain how to use internal stylesheet and external style sheet.<br><br> Lastly, after I figured out the internal stylesheet and external one,  I could design my website by using css stylesheet code and even javascript one on html not on external stylesheet, allowing me to make website quickly and efficiently.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
<br>
<br>
1. Firstly I did well for my website is Navigation bar because I put the background image which is pattern that makes my navigation bar beautiful and intellectual.
<br>
<br>
2. Secondly, what I did well is I used gold colour and Arial font for my website's texts that make my website look vivid.
<br>
<br>

What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time? 
<br>
<br>

My website has Login and Register pages, however, since I do not run my website server and my website do not have databases at the moment, people cannot login and register at the moment.  Next time, If I run my website, my login and register pages might be fully available.
<br>
<br>
<hr>

What resources were used when creating your work? 
<br>
<br>
I watched the youtube videos that explain how to use bootstrap and how to deal with html, css and javascript. <br><br> Also when I want to use some codes that the videos do not explain, I search on google and reference some useful codes from <br>https://www.w3schools.com/
<br>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
Appendices: there is a Appendices folder in my website folder and it includes Site map and wireframes images.
